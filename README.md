# RandomImageGenerator
A simple script that creates images with a random number of elements (squares). Intended for use in ML NN practice.

Change canvas size from 42x42 but remember to:
- Change randint maximum values
- Possibly change rn maximum values so that elements may be bigger/smaller
- Change threshold to allow elements to be drawn across the new canvas size

I've used this code to quickly create labeled images to train a TensorFlow Neural Network in trying to learn how to count elements.
A very rough approach at that, but may be useful for other projects.
